# Deterministic Pipeline (Flux) — Granular Stage-by-Stage Explanation

Generated at: 2025-08-24T17:01:02.921325

This document describes the canonical, deterministic pipeline. Execution is strictly topological: each node runs only after all its dependencies have produced outputs.

Determinism Principles:

- Fixed process graph and insertion-ordered traversal ensure a stable topological order.

- Each node declares explicit dependencies; execution respects these constraints.

- If a module lacks a callable entrypoint (process/run/execute/main/handle), a structured, non-mutating pass-through is used to preserve flow and traceability.

- A value-chain check ensures each step contributes measurable value; under-contributing nodes are auto-enhanced with quality/validation metrics to maintain monotonic value growth.
