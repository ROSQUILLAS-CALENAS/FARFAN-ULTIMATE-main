"""
Architecture fitness functions for phase layering enforcement.

This package contains tests that validate the canonical phase flow:
I → X → K → A → L → R → O → G → T → S

These tests ensure that no backward dependencies exist between phases,
maintaining the integrity of the architectural constraints.
