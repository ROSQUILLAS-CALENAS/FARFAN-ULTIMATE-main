# DNP Causal Correction System

## Overview
Implementation of DNP causal correction system with baseline deviation measurement, correction factor calculation, robustness scoring, and human rights validation.

## Key Features
- Baseline deviation measurement using documented formulas
- Causal correction factor computation with confidence intervals  
- Robustness scoring for reliability assessment
- Human rights alignment validation
- Comprehensive audit trails with deterministic ordering

## Components
- `BaselineDeviation`: Measures deviations from established baselines
- `CorrectionFactor`: Calculates adjustment factors using documented formulas
- `RobustnessScore`: Assesses reliability of corrections
- `HumanRightsAlignment`: Validates alignment with human rights standards
- `DNPCausalCorrectionSystem`: Main orchestration class

## Usage
```python
system = DNPCausalCorrectionSystem()
result = system.process_correction_cycle(measurements, baselines, categories)
```

## Formulas
- Correction Coefficient: `C = 1 + α * |D|^β`
- Multiplicative Factor: Sigmoid normalization
- Additive Adjustment: `A = |D| * sign(D) * log(1 + |D|)`
