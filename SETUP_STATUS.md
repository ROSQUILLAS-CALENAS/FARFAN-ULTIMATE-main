# EGW Query Expansion - Setup Status

## Initial Setup Attempted

The repository has been cloned and environment setup attempted, but **installation failed due to insufficient disk space**.

### System Requirements vs Available Space
- **Required**: ~2-3GB for full PyTorch + ML dependencies
- **Available**: 1.4GB free disk space
- **Status**: ❌ Installation failed

### What Was Attempted

1. ✅ Created virtual environment in `venv/` (following .gitignore convention)
2. ❌ Package installation failed on PyTorch (73.6MB download) due to disk space

### Required Setup Commands

Based on TONKOTSU.md, the complete setup would be:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Minimal Setup for Testing

If space constraints persist, try installing only core dependencies:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --no-cache-dir torch numpy scikit-learn transformers pandas pyyaml tqdm pytest
```

### Next Steps

1. **Free up disk space** (need ~2GB more)
2. **Re-run setup commands** from TONKOTSU.md
3. **Validate installation**: `python validate_installation.py`

### Repository Structure Confirmed

- ✅ Virtual environment should be in `venv/` (excluded in .gitignore)
- ✅ Requirements files available: `requirements.txt`, `requirements-minimal.txt`  
- ✅ Build/test commands documented in TONKOTSU.md
- ✅ Validation script available: `validate_installation.py`

## Status: Setup Incomplete - Disk Space Issue
