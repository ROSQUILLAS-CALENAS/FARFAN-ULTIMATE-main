# Performance Monitoring System for EGW Query Expansion Remediation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive performance monitoring system designed to support remediation work on the EGW Query Expansion System. The system captures, analyzes, and reports key performance metrics to establish baselines and detect regressions during remediation phases.

## Components

### 1. Performance Monitoring Script (`scripts/performance_monitor.py`)

A comprehensive Python script that provides:
- **System metrics capture** (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O)
- **Test execution monitoring** with performance profiling
- **Build process monitoring** with resource usage tracking
- **Baseline establishment** for regression detection
- **Continuous monitoring** capabilities
- **Automated reporting** with threshold validation

### 2. Branching Strategy (`BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`)

Defines systematic branching conventions for remediation work:
- **Branch naming patterns** for different remediation types
- **Merge policies** with mandatory review and testing checkpoints
- **Rollback procedures** with specific git commands for different scenarios
- **Emergency response protocols** with time-based escalation

### 3. Remediation Process (`REMEDIATION_PROCESS.md`)

Comprehensive step-by-step process documentation:
- **Five-phase remediation workflow** from identification to deployment
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common failure scenarios
- **Performance monitoring checkpoints** with defined metrics and thresholds
- **Recovery procedures** for immediate and planned responses

## Usage Examples

### Establishing Performance Baselines

```bash
# Capture comprehensive baseline before starting remediation
python3 scripts/performance_monitor.py --capture-baseline \
    --save assessment/baseline_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M).json \
    --report assessment/baseline_report.md

# Example output:
# Running performance benchmark suite...
# Results saved to: assessment/baseline_20241209_1430.json
# Report saved to: assessment/baseline_report.md
```

### Continuous Monitoring During Remediation

```bash
# Monitor system performance during long-running remediation work
python3 scripts/performance_monitor.py --continuous-monitor \
    --duration 3600 --save assessment/remediation_monitoring.json

# Monitor with custom sampling interval
python3 scripts/performance_monitor.py --continuous-monitor \
    --duration 1800 --config custom_monitor_config.json
```

### Regression Detection

```bash
# Compare current performance with baseline after changes
python3 scripts/performance_monitor.py --benchmark \
    --compare-baseline assessment/baseline_20241209_1430.json \
    --save assessment/post_remediation_comparison.json

# Example output showing regression detection:
# Status: regression_detected
# Regressions found: 2
# Improvements found: 1
# 
# ## Regressions:
# - memory_mb_max: 23.45% (medium)
# - test_execution_times_avg: 15.67% (medium)
```

### Integration with Remediation Workflow

```bash
# Pre-remediation validation
python3 scripts/performance_monitor.py --capture-baseline \
    --save assessment/pre_remediation_baseline.json

# During remediation - monitor specific operations
python3 scripts/performance_monitor.py --benchmark \
    --save assessment/remediation_progress.json

# Post-remediation validation  
python3 scripts/performance_monitor.py --compare-baseline \
    assessment/pre_remediation_baseline.json \
    --save assessment/remediation_impact_analysis.json
```

## Key Performance Metrics

### System-Level Metrics
- **CPU utilization** (average, peak, 95th percentile)
- **Memory usage** (total, peak, available)
- **Disk I/O** (read/write throughput)
- **Network I/O** (sent/received data volumes)

### Application-Level Metrics
- **Test execution time** (individual and suite totals)
- **Build duration** (compilation and packaging time)
- **Response times** (API and processing latencies)
- **Error rates** (test failures, build failures)

### Performance Thresholds
```python
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "response_time_p95": 2.0,      # 95th percentile < 2 seconds
    "memory_usage_peak": 1.5e9,    # Peak memory < 1.5GB  
    "cpu_utilization_avg": 0.7,    # Average CPU < 70%
    "error_rate": 0.001,           # Error rate < 0.1%
    "throughput_min": 100,         # Min 100 requests/second
    "test_execution_time": 1800,   # Test suite < 30 minutes
    "build_time": 300              # Build time < 5 minutes
}
```

## Configuration

### Custom Monitoring Configuration (`monitor_config.json`)

  "sampling_interval": 1.0,
  "memory_threshold_mb": 1500,
  "cpu_threshold_percent": 80.0,

## Reporting and Analysis

### Automated Report Generation
The performance monitoring system generates comprehensive reports including:

- **Executive Summary**: Overall system health and performance status
- **Metric Comparisons**: Before/after analysis with percentage changes
- **Regression Analysis**: Identified performance degradations with severity levels
- **Threshold Validation**: Pass/fail status against defined performance thresholds
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance patterns and predictions

## Best Practices

### 1. Baseline Management
- Capture baselines before any significant changes
- Store baselines with descriptive timestamps and branch information
- Version baselines alongside code changes
- Archive baselines for historical trend analysis

### 2. Monitoring Strategy
- Use continuous monitoring for long-running remediation work
- Set appropriate sampling intervals based on operation duration
- Monitor both system and application-specific metrics
- Establish alert thresholds for immediate issue detection

### 3. Regression Detection
- Compare against appropriate baselines (not always the most recent)
- Consider seasonal and environmental variations
- Use statistical significance testing for small changes
- Document performance trade-offs in remediation decisions

### 4. Integration Points
- Integrate performance monitoring into CI/CD pipelines
- Include performance gates in merge request validation
- Automate baseline updates for accepted performance changes
- Link performance reports to remediation tracking systems

This performance monitoring system provides a comprehensive foundation for systematic, data-driven remediation work while maintaining system performance and detecting regressions early in the development process.
